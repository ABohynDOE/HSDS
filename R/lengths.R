#' Guessing lengths
#'
#' Students guessing the length of a room in metres and in feet.
#'
#' Shortly after metric units of length were officially introduced in Australia,
#' each of a group of 44 students was asked to guess, to the nearest metre, the
#' width of the lecture hall in which they were sitting.
#' Another group of 69 students in the same room was asked to guess the width in
#' feet, to the nearest foot. The true width of the hall was 13.1 metres (43.0
#' feet).
