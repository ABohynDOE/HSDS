\title{Software system failures}
\format{
A data frame with 136 rows and 2 columns:
\describe{
\item{time}{Time to failure in CPU seconds}
\item{failure_id}{Failure number (1 to 136)}
}
}
\source{
{Musa, J.D., Iannino, A. and Okumoto, K. (1987) \emph{Software reliability: measurement,prediction, application}, New York: McGraw-Hill, 305.}
}
\usage{
software
}
\description{
These data give the failure times (in CPU seconds, measured in terms of
execution time) of a real-time command and control software system.
The data can be used as an example for fitting various reliability models.
Musa et al. recommend fitting a nonhomogenous Poisson process with linearly
exponentially decreasing failure time.
