  \item{fertilization}{Type of fertilization (`cross` of `self`)}
  \item{height}{Height of the plant in inches}

\description{
Pairs of seedlings of the same age, one produced by cross-fertilization and
the other by self-fertilization, were grown together so that the members of
each pair were reared under nearly identical conditions.
The aim was to demonstrate the greater vigour of the cross-fertilized plants.
The data are the final heights of each plant after a fixed period of time.
Darwin consulted Galton about the analysis of these data, and they were
discussed further in Fisher's Design of Experiments.
